description: Introduction
---

Create-gstore is different from other state management solutions because
it lets you take any custom React hook and turn it into a global state.
This means you can easily share state and logic across components
without prop drilling or complex context setup.

### Features

- Share any React hook's state and logic globally
- Optimized re-renders using selectors
- Compatible with all React hooks - useState, useReducer, useContext, etc.
- TypeScript support
- Tiny bundle size
- No dependencies
